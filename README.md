nextcloud aio configuration with a remote reverse proxy 

If you want to use Nextcloud All-in-One by using its Docker imgae you can find this here:
https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/

I wanted to use the Nextcloud-AIO container, but with my existing reverse proxy (nginx). It cost me a few evenings to get this working. To save others from having todo the same trouble-shooting I have documented my setup in a mindmap, as you can see below. The Image is large but for copy-pating stuff the pdf is better.
